## Introduction

This repository provides the results from an analysis of heart disease mortality rates in the US during the period of 2010-2019. Because heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the US, stakeholders such as healthcare providers and administrators could use analysis such as this to assess the impact of heart disease on healthcare systems, forecast future healthcare needs, and optimize resource allocation.

The data was provided by the [Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)](https://data.cdc.gov/Heart-Disease-Stroke-Prevention/National-Vital-Statistics-System-NVSS-National-Car/kztq-p2jf/about_data) and exported from the [National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)](https://data.cdc.gov/Heart-Disease-Stroke-Prevention/National-Vital-Statistics-System-NVSS-National-Car/kztq-p2jf/about_data). 

## Objective
